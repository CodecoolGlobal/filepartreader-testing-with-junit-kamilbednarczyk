1. Is CSV file correct choice for complicated data (string with multiple lines and different 'special' signs)?
2. Where to put test resources?
3. Isn't it weird to check if we read file? - Maybe only small file read is sufficient enough so it's ok.
4. Is it ok to use 'native' setup function in tests? - just a setter.
5. Read is used only in FilePartReader class - change access to private and test only on readLines? Maybe extracting the file
reading functionality to its own class and injecting it into the part reader would be a better idea?
6. What about testing private methods? Do we test them through public method? Should it be public? Is there something
wrong with class design?
